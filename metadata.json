With engagement suits designed to withstand extreme temperatures, low-to-zero gravity, and other rigors found in the vacuum of space, this role is fully capable of EVA combat.

Believing that these efforts would ultimately locate Halo, an array of ringworlds which they believed held delivery into the afterlife; they began scouring the galaxy in search of these artifacts, violently integrating species on worlds they razed in the process.  As the Covenant collective of species grew, its threat grew as well, until it came in contact with humanity. During the course of this protracted war, the Covenant's internal framework could not be maintained and fell apart. At its breaking, the Sangheili momentarily sided with mankind to defeat their former allies, but the end of the war did not usher in peace. With their core ideals fractured, the Sangheili fell into civil war.

For three hundred years, the Forerunners engaged the Flood, hoping that they would somehow discover a cure, despite world after world falling to the parasite. Eventually, they were forced to do the unthinkable and created a powerful weapon network called Halo. These rings, when fired, could effectively destroy the Flood, but would also destroy all sentient life across the galaxy in the process.
